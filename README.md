# TFM REPO

The repository is organized into different branches, each branch grouping together one of the different studies conducted during the project. The "first test" section focuses on the initial investigation where various architecture models and datasets were tested to find one that fits our requirements. The "calibration" branch contains code related to the implementation of the studied calibration methods. Lastly, there are two additional sections, one focused on YOLO and the other on the different approaches once the network probabilities have been calibrated.
